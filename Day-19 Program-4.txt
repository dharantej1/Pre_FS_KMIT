/*
Krishna is working on strings, He is trying to modify the string which has to 
be first in lexicographic order.
You can modify the string using following operations:
 	- Interchnage the characters at the given pair of indices.
 	- You can perform the interchange of the pair any number of times.
 	- You will be given I number of pairs
 
Example: 
--------
If pair is ->[i,j], you can interchange the characters at i-th and j-th indices
with each other.
  
Krishna is given a String S, an integer I and I pairs of indices.
Can you help Krishna to find the string that can be formed 
after performing interchange operations, which has to be first in the
lexicographical order.
 
Note: String contains only lowercase letters.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: A string S
Line-2: An integer I, number of interchanges.
Next I lines: Two space separated integers, interchange pair.
 
Output Format:
--------------
A string, lexicographic smallest string after the interchanges
  
Sample Input-1:
---------------
cba
2
0 1
1 2
   
Sample Output-1:
----------------
abc
 
Explaination: 
-------------
Interchange s[0] and s[1], s = "bca"
Interchange s[1] and s[2], s = "bac"
Interchange s[0] and s[1], s = "abc"
  
Sample Input-2:
---------------
dcab
2
0 3
1 2
   
Sample Output-2:
----------------
bacd
   
Explaination: 
-------------
Interchange s[0] and s[3], s = "bcad"
Interchange s[1] and s[2], s = "bacd"
   
Sample Input-3:
---------------
dcab
3
0 3
1 2
0 2
  
Sample Output-3:
----------------
abcd
   
Explaination: 
-------------
Interchange s[0] and s[3], s = "bcad"
Interchange s[0] and s[2], s = "acbd"
Interchange s[1] and s[2], s = "abcd"
