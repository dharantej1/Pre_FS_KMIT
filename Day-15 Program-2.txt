Ganesh has a habit of writing the words in backward order,
and writes the sentence without spaces.
 
Ganesh is given a sentence S (without spaces) and an integer C
His way of backward writing the sentence is as follows:
   - Break the sentence into 2C length words from begining to end.
   - Write the first C letters in backward direction of every 2C length word.
   - if there is a leftover word at the end of S with lenth lessthan 2C, then 
   - if length is lessthan C, write all the letters in backward direction.
   - if length is greater than or equal to C, write the first C letters
          in backward direction and keep the rest as it is.
           
 And return the sentence S after writing is completed.
 
Example of backward writing: 
Given sentence, S= "hellokmit" and C=2
Break the sentence into words: hell, okmi, t
Now apply backward writing on each word: ehll, komi, t
So, the final sentence is "ehllkomit"
