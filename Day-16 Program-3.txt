From the first two persons in queue, we take two $25 notes.
For the next two persons in queue, we take a $50 note and give back a $25 note.
For the last customer, we take $100, but can't give balance of $75 back because 
we only have two $50 notes. Since not every person in the queue received the ticket 
and balance, the answer is false.
