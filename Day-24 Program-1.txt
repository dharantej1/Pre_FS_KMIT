/*
Nagesh has given two words to check whether the first word 'source' is a
sub-series of second word 'target'.

A sub-series from a word can be formed by removing 0 or more characters without 
changing the relative order of other characters in the word.

For example, 'nest' is a subseries of a word 'interst' , where as 'rest' is not.

Help Nagesh to return true if source is a subseries of target, otherwise false.

Constraints:
 0 <= source.length <= 100
 0 <= target.length <= 10^4
 source and target consist only of lowercase English letters.
