In one alteration, you can replace one female '0' with a  male '1' or vice versa.
 
Your task to find and print the minimum number of alterations needed 
to make the line to follow alternate gender sequence.
 
Input Format:
-------------
A binary String, S.
 
Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, minimum number of alterations.
 

Sample Input-1:
